Car detection and speed estimation on my street using OpenCV, with a Logitech C920.

Uses background subtraction by taking a mean image of the area and measuring a large car "blob" as it drives by. 
speed detection code is written in c++ (open source)(https://github.com/Adii285/detect-cars). Webpage is being made using html5 on frontend and javascript mainly on backend.
